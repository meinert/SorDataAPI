# Introduction

In this assignment we are looking at data for healthcare organizations.

The data is sourced from Sundhedsv√¶senets Organisationsregister (SOR) (Healthcare Organization Registry), which provides
the data in CSV
format ([`sor.csv`](https://sor-filer.sundhedsdata.dk/sor_produktion/data/sor/sorcsv/V_1_2_1_19/sor.csv)).

### Data in the csv file

The CSV file contains a lot of information about the organizations.
The relevant data is:

| Property        | CSV Header name   | Description                                                                   |
|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Name            | `Enhedsnavn`      | Name of the organization                                                      |
| Type            | `Enhedstype`      | Type of organization, e. g. private ("privat"), municipality ("kommune") etc. |
| Region          | `P_Region`        | Region                                                                        |
| Specialty       | `Hovedspeciale`   | Main specialty                                                                |
| SOR code        | `SOR-kode`        | SOR-code                                                                      |
| Parent SOR code | `Parent-SOR-kode` | SOR-code of parent organization                                               |
| CVR             | `CVR`             | CVR-number                                                                    |

The organizations are organized in a hierarchy, like this:

```
- Organization A
  - Child Org A1
    - Child Org A1.1
      - Child Org A1.1.1
    - Child Org A1.2
  - Child Org A2
- Organization B
  ...
```

In this example "Child Org A1" has parent "Organization A" and immediate children "Child Org A1.1" and "Child Org A1.2".

"Organization A" is the "top level parent" of all organizations below it in the hierarchy.

# Assignment

In this assignment you are tasked with building a small application in .Net Core(latest version) using either Visual Studio og Visual Studio Code

The application should provide data for healthcare organizations via an API.

The API must include 2 endpoints:

## Lookup Endpoint

This endpoint allows for looking up organizations by SOR-code, which is the unique identifier.
It takes the SOR-code as input parameter, and the response contains the following information:

- Name
- Type
- Region
- SOR-code
- CVR
- Include parent organization (if any)
- Include all immediate child organizations (if any)

## Traverse Endpoint
This endpoint allows for traversing the hierarchy of organizations upwards, finding the top level parent organization for any given organization.
This endpoint takes a SOR code as input parameter, and the response contains the top level parent organization in that hierarchy.

## Requirement for code test
The solution must be well documented with comments in code and explaniations.
The solution must be able to run in Visual Studio as a standalone solution. 
The solution must be testable through web(Swagger or OpenAPI) when the project is running. 

## Optional tasks
Use caching to improve speed when reading the sor csv file

# Delivery of the solution
The project must be added to github and shared with github user https://github.com/Birger100
When the solution is added you must send a mail to birger.hoejrup@rn.dk and anlo@rn.dk to inform that the solution i submitted.
Do NOT attach the solution to mail! Mails with attachements often will be lost in spamfilter.
